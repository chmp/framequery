# framequery - SQL on dataframes 

framequery allows to query dataframes with SQL. Currently it targets both 
[pandas][] and [dask][], while aiming for [PostgreSQL][postgres] compatibility.
framequery is also integrated with [sqlalchemy][].

[dask]: dask.pydata.org
[pandas]: pandas.pydata.org
[postgres]: https://www.postgresql.org/
[sqlalchemy]: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

## Getting started

Install framequery with `pip install framequery` and use 
[`framequery.execute`](docs/API.md#framequeryexecute) to run queries against
dataframes in your scope:

```python
import framequery as fq
import pandas as pd

stores = pd.read_csv('data/stores.csv')
sales = pd.read_csv('data/sales.csv')

sales_by_country = fq.execute("""
    SELECT country, sum(sales) as total_sales

    FROM sales
    JOIN stores
    ON sales.store_id = stores.id

    GROUP BY country
""")

print(sales_by_country)
```

For a details usage see the [usage guide](docs/Usage.md) and the 
[API reference](docs/API.md).
